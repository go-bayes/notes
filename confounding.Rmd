Imagine a word in which we have the following relationships:

```{r}
library(ggdag)
# code for creating a DAG
ggdag_ov <- dagify(Y ~ X + M,
                   M ~ X + U,
                   exposure = "X",
                   outcome = "Y")%>%
  control_for("M")

# plot the DAG
ggdag_ov %>%
  ggdag() + theme_dag_blank()
```

Suppose that we want to write a mediation model in which we partition out the direct effect of X -> Y and total effect of X--> Y through M.  However there is an unmeasured neighbourhood effect of U on M.  Not that neighbourhood is a collider. 


```{r}
# use this code
ggdag::ggdag_collider( ggdag_ov )  + theme_dag_blank()
```

Because of this, neighbourhood effects can lead to confounding, making it appear as though the effect of X on Y is negative. 

To show this, we simulate some data:

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
N <- 100
b_XM <- 1 # direct effect of X on M
b_XY <- 0 # direct effect of X on Y
b_MY <- 1 # direct effect of M on Y
b_U <- 2 # direct effect of U on M and Y”

set.seed(1)

U <- 2 * rethinking::rbern( N , 0.5 ) - 1
X <- rnorm( N )
M <- rnorm( N , b_XM*X + b_U*U )
Y <- rnorm( N , b_MY*M + b_XY * X +  b_U*U )
d <- data.frame( Y=Y, M=M, X=X , U=U )
```


Note that in our simulation, X has a positive effect on Y. However, M is a collider, and including M in our model makes it appear as if X is negatively related to Y, even though in our simulation there is no relationship.

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
lm( Y ~ X + M, data = d) %>%
  summary()
```


Writing the full mediation model:


```{r}
bmlm::mlm_path_plot(xlab = "Focal\n(X)",
              mlab = "Mediator\n(M)",
              ylab = "Outcome\n(Y)")
```



```{r}
path_m <- brms::bf(M ~ X)
path_y <- brms::bf(Y ~ X + M)

m1 <- brms::brm(
  path_m + path_y + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = d,
  file = here::here("models", "mediation-counfound-simulation")
)

# output
parameters::model_parameters(m1)
```


For the mediation model we may recover the indirect, direct and total effects as follow:

```{r}
# get posterior distributions
post <- brms::posterior_samples(m1)

# sum and multiply the posterior distributions to obain parameter estimates
post2 <- post %>%
  dplyr::transmute(
    a = b_M_X,
    b = b_Y_M,
    cp = b_Y_X,
    me = a * b,
    c = cp + me#,
    # pme = me / c
  )
```

The direct effect (cp) appears to be negative. 


```{r}
# plot the results
mcmc_intervals(post2) 
```


But recall, we simulated a direct effect coefficient of 0. This is the result of conditioning on a collider, which opens a path between X and U. 

```{r}
ggdag::ggdag_dseparated(ggdag_ov, controlling_for = "M", collider_lines = TRUE )  + theme_dag_blank()
```


This time, let's included the previously un-modelled effect of neighbourhoods. 


```{r}
path_m <- brms::bf(M ~ X )
path_y <- brms::bf(Y ~ X + M + U)

m2 <- brms::brm(
  path_m + path_y + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = d,
  file = here::here("models", "mediation-counfound-simulation-2")
)

# output
parameters::model_parameters(m2)
```

Graphing results in a model that adjusts for neighbourhoods effecs we have

```{r}
# get posterior distributions
post2 <- brms::posterior_samples(m2)

# sum and multiply the posterior distributions to obain parameter estimates
post2.2 <- post2 %>%
  dplyr::transmute(
    a = b_M_X,
    b = b_Y_M,
    cp = b_Y_X,
    me = a * b,
    c = cp + me#,
    # pme = me / c
  )

# plot the results
mcmc_intervals(post2.2) 
```

We recover the proper direct effect (namely 0), 

Recall that in our simulation X -> M, and it is for this reason the total effect of X on Y is positive. 

In short, if we are modelling relationships in which covariates are affected by neighbourhood effects, we might confound our results. 

The goods news is that for models in which we are only interested in the total effect of X on Y, it is sufficient for us to condition only X.  (All backdoor paths are closed)

```{r}
# code for creating a DAG
ggdag_ov2 <- dagify(Y ~ X + M,
                   M ~ X + U,
                   exposure = "X",
                   outcome = "Y")

ggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(ggdag_ov2)
```


Doing so gives us X's total effect (which arises through X's effect on M).

```{r}
```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
lm( Y ~ X, data = d) %>%
  summary()
```
```
