Each cell in the matrix represents the count of individuals transitioning from one state to another. The rows correspond to the state at baseline (From), and the columns correspond to the state at the treatment wave (To). Diagonal entries (in bold) signify the number of individuals who remained in their initial state across both waves. Off-diagonal entries signify the transitions of individuals from their baseline state to a different state in the treatment wave. A higher number on the diagonal relative to the off-diagonal entries in the same row indicates greater stability in a state.
